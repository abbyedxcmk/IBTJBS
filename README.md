## [Description](#description)
The Home application uses APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that pull in the latest rates, snapshot figures on mortgage rates and interest, and relevant housing market news. By working together, these APIs create a more cohesive snapshot of the property and mortgage landscape for everyone involved.


## [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)



### Technical Acceptance Criteria:
* Use Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIsLinks to an external site..
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
* Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

### Presentation Requirements:
* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application
* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
* Demo: Show your stuff!
* Directions for Future Development
* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository

## [Installation](#installation)

The Home application is engineered to streamline the process of acquiring real 
estate data by harnessing the power of JavaScript and third-party APIs. 
Upon page load, users interact with a form to input mortgage-related information, 
which triggers a seamless API request to a mortgage calculator service. 
This functionality is implemented using asynchronous JavaScript calls, ensuring 
that the most recent mortgage rates and calculations are fetched without 
disrupting the user experience. 
The app leverages HTTP GET requests with appropriate headers to authenticate 
and retrieve data in real-time.
In addition, the application integrates with a property listing API, allowing users to 
search for properties based on specific locations. 
The data fetched includes image URLs, property types, prices, and other relevant 
details, all formatted neatly in British Pounds using the International Number 
Format for consistency and readability.
